#### **New York City Coronavirus** 

#### Project Overview 

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis and deeply impacts every aspect of our daily lives. This project focused on tracking and analyzing the current COVID pandemic spread in NYC across the five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. 

In addition, we included studies of relations between pandemic and its influential factors: age, income and traffic. Moreover, we analyzed impacted areas due to the burst of the virus: job market, business license application, certificate of occupancy issued for new buildings, public transportation, emergency notification for public health, and permitted events. Based on current data, we forecasted the number of positive cases using machine learning algorithms. The data used in this project are derived from NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), New York State Department of Health, THE CITY and NYC Open Data.
